Libraries have been installed in:

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'

   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

This program shows how to access the Temporal Pooler directly by demonstrating
how to create a TP instance, train it with vectors, get predictions, and inspect
the state.

The code here runs a very simple version of sequence learning, with one
cell per column. The TP is trained with the simple sequence A->B->C->D->E

HOMEWORK: once you have understood exactly what is going on here, try changing
cellsPerColumn to 4. What is the difference between once cell per column and 4
cells per column?

PLEASE READ THROUGH THE CODE COMMENTS - THEY EXPLAIN THE OUTPUT IN DETAIL
